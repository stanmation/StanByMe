This is my Udacity assignment. I'm making a dating app that can chat to other users by using keyword matches. 

__Instructions on how to use (for reviewers):__ 
- Sign up using your email and fill in 'About Me' and 'Looking For' fields
- To test out if you can detect another user, sign up using another email, and make sure 'Looking For' of one user (for example, try fill in with "Relationship Hardworking Woman") has at least one matching keyword to another user's 'About Me' (for example, try fill in with "Man Hardworking Old"). 
- Login and your matching users should appear on the UICollectionView page. 

__Technologies used:__ Swift 3, GeoFire, RESTful API, Core Data, UIKit, Firebase
